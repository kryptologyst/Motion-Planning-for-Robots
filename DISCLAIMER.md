# SAFETY DISCLAIMER

## CRITICAL WARNING

This motion planning software is designed for **RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**.

## DO NOT USE ON REAL ROBOTS WITHOUT EXPERT REVIEW

### Safety Requirements for Real Robot Deployment

1. **Expert Review Required**: All code must be reviewed by qualified robotics engineers before hardware deployment

2. **Simulation Testing**: Comprehensive testing in simulation environments is mandatory before any real robot usage

3. **Safety Guards**: Implement proper safety mechanisms including:
   - Emergency stop systems
   - Velocity and acceleration limits
   - Collision detection and avoidance
   - Workspace boundary enforcement
   - Real-time monitoring systems

4. **Hardware Safety**: Ensure all hardware components meet safety standards:
   - Certified sensors and actuators
   - Redundant safety systems
   - Fail-safe mechanisms
   - Regular maintenance schedules

5. **Operator Training**: All operators must be properly trained on:
   - Emergency procedures
   - System limitations
   - Safety protocols
   - Risk assessment

### Known Limitations

- Path planning does not guarantee collision-free execution
- Dynamic obstacles are not handled in real-time
- No consideration for robot dynamics or control limitations
- Assumes perfect sensor data and environment knowledge
- No fault tolerance or error recovery mechanisms

### Liability Disclaimer

- This software comes with **NO WARRANTY**
- Users assume **ALL RISK** and liability
- Developers are **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for any damages, injuries, or losses
- Use at your own risk and discretion

### Recommended Safety Practices

1. Always test in simulation first
2. Use conservative velocity limits
3. Implement multiple safety layers
4. Have emergency stop readily available
5. Monitor system continuously during operation
6. Maintain detailed logs of all operations
7. Regular safety audits and reviews

## For Research Use Only

This software is intended for:
- Academic research
- Educational purposes
- Algorithm development and testing
- Simulation studies

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION ROBOTICS SYSTEMS WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY REVIEW**
